Conversion to Delve format

1) Convert "," to white space
2) Stratify to ensure equal representaion of classes
3) Randomly reshuffle the ordering of the first 10,560 to be
used as a test set. Leave the remaining as stratified. This has the effect
that the base rate class-distributions in the train and test sets
may be different.
